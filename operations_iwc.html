                    <p>&ldquo;And so gradually I shifted from technical architect to social architect. From caring about technical designs to caring about people and the psychology that drives them. Because in the end, this is what seems to make the difference between a working project and a failure. &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;... The man who is mentally alert and intelligent is for this very reason entirely unsuited to what would, for him, be the grinding monotony of work of this character.

Airlines are a case in point. If an airline system loses a reservation ... this will be detected when the passenger attempts to check in. All airlines have procedures to handle this kind of problem ... It is therefore not worthwhile to implement complex software processes to guarantee no loss of records. &rdquo;</p>
