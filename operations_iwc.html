					<p align="left">There was a view of normal... </p>

					<p align="left">... if we predicted the future we wouldn't be rational about it</p>

					<h2>The People Problem</h2>
					<blockquote cite="http://hintjens.com/blog:125">
                    <p>&ldquo;And so gradually I shifted from technical architect to social architect. From caring about technical designs to caring about people and the psychology that drives them. Because in the end, this is what seems to make the difference between a working project and a failure. &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Now one of the very first requirements for a man who is fit to handle pig iron as a regular occupation is that he shall be so stupid and so phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental make-up the ox than any other type...  &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;... The man who is mentally alert and intelligent is for this very reason entirely unsuited to what would, for him, be the grinding monotony of work of this character. Therefore the workman who is best suited to handling pig iron is unable to understand the real science of doing this class of work. &rdquo;</p>

					<h2>Over to you ...</h2>

					<p align="left">Availability - Acceptability of Planned/Unplanned downtime?</p>
					<p align="left">Security - Privacy? Detection or Protection?</p>

                    <p>&ldquo; In a real business situation, many organizations will throw up their hands and say, we will wait for a complaint and do a manual adjustment. Airlines are a case in point. If an airline system loses a reservation ... this will be detected when the passenger attempts to check in. All airlines have procedures to handle this kind of problem ... It is therefore not worthwhile to implement complex software processes to guarantee no loss of records. &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo; In 2000/2001, to make ITIL more accessible (and affordable), ITIL v2 consolidated the publications into nine logical "sets" that grouped related process-guidelines to match different aspects of IT management, applications and services. The Service Management sets (Service Support and Service Delivery) were by far the most widely used ... &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo; ITIL 2007 edition (previously known as version 3) is an extension of ITIL v2 and fully replaced it following the completion of the withdrawal period on 30 June 2011.[4] ITIL 2007 provides a more holistic perspective on the full life cycle of services ... Most of the v2 activities remained untouched in 2007, but some significant changes in terminology were introduced ... &rdquo;</p>
